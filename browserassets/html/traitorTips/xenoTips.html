	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to serve your Queen, spread weeds, and infect the all of the survivors on the station.</p>

		2. Xenomorphic aliens are split into two main types and five subcastes. <em>Drones</em> have the very important job of planting weeds, secreting resin for building,
			and building resin structures. Weeds slow down humans significantly, making it difficult for them to invade your hive. <em>Sentinels</em>,
			who evolve from Drones, are tasked with defending the hive, and have better stats which help them do so. <em>Warriors</em> are a very powerful
			caste which is expected to expand the hive by infecting humans. They evolve from Sentinels. <em>Praetorians</em> are the extremely durable guardians of the hive and the Queen,
			and also evolve from Sentinels.The <em>Queen</em> is the autocratic ruler of the hive, whose will cannot be disobeyed. She evolves from a Praetorian.<br>
