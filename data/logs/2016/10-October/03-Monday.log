[16:03:44] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: it could be added to the map, or something similar
[16:03:44] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Janky build mode
[16:03:52] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: We coulr
[16:03:58] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: replace wizard ship
[16:04:09] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: and just toss in a teleporter
[16:04:26] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: If I could use the weird as mapping tools i would do it
[16:05:43] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I would rather have a couple of small pred ships like that one
[16:05:46] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: but like I was saying
[16:05:55] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: what if preds had an objective to get ransom from survivors
[16:06:05] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Ehhhh
[16:06:06] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: in exchange, they keep the highest bidder protected from aliens
[16:06:15] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: they also collect alien skulls
[16:06:15] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: they dont speak any of the same language
[16:06:26] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I could make translators
[16:06:40] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: and tbh
[16:06:44] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: And preds arn&#39;t on either seid in lore they just kill whoever would be the best to hunt humans with weapons, alien warriors
[16:06:48] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I don&#39;t see why we have to follow language lore memes
[16:07:12] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Ye but, dont make them in either side that would upset people :c
[16:07:24] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: they could spawn when half of either side dies
[16:07:47] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: well, generally, wouldn&#39;t they hunt the strongest side?
[16:08:03] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: which is almost always alien unless survivors take over cargo and cargo isn&#39;t broken and they get a fuckton of lasers
[16:08:34] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: if they&#39;re hunting the strongest side, I think humans should be able to bribe them with gifts or something 
[16:08:41] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: if they&#39;re hunting aliens, I mean
[16:08:44] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: No, they would hunt on a case by case if they saw a human who had a crowbar or spear they would melee them or stealth kill, an alien queen may get a plasma blast and some spear throws it depends on who he runs into he would prolly want a little of both side&#39;s skulls
[16:09:47] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: they hunt for trophys and human trophys and xeno trophys are both worth something to them, a human would have to save a preds life in order to be spared but preds dont usually kill cowards but some kill especially cowards
[16:10:08] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: so much lore
[16:10:13] SAY: Shitty Bill (NPC) : Pour one out for Father Jack...
[16:10:19] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I think they should just be given an objective to get a certain number of heads, but
[16:10:23] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: I would love to write up the rules and regs and I could fish up sounds 
[16:10:30] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: they already have that in the game
[16:10:32] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: the targets should specifically be humans who have a lot of weapons
[16:10:41] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: or warrior aliens should be prioritized
[16:10:49] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: or something which makes it as challenging as is currently possible
[16:11:21] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Preds have a trophy objective already, and  all the preds need is a debuff to their spear stun time and damage as well as lower the damage or make the plasma rifle not recharge
[16:11:38] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: spears aren&#39;t going to stun anymore
[16:11:39] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] deleted the empty pedestal at (<a href='?src=%admin_ref%;action=jumptocoords;target=81,154,1' title='Jump to Coords'>81,154,1</a>)
[16:11:48] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: it should be stamina damage, stuns too op
[16:12:01] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I&#39;d like to make them inferior to warriors, to be honest
[16:12:14] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: No the pread spear is the only one that stuns, adn they would need a damage buff
[16:12:34] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: yeah, I know it is
[16:12:39] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: the stun is getting removed 
[16:12:41] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: I mean it is one pred versus both humans and aliens he would need some advantage or hes just a survivor with a mask
[16:12:41] SAY: Alien Queen (Rogeriosatoshi) [TRAITOR] : players
[16:12:55] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: he would probably be better than most aliens
[16:13:01] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: well
[16:13:09] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: here is how ive seen it
[16:13:28] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: younge predator only has  a spear because he is not blooded and so is only on par with say a drone or two
[16:13:36] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: blooded pred has claws spear and cloak
[16:13:57] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: warrior has the gun spear cloak better armor and the mask
[16:14:17] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: and &#34;nobles&#34; have spears guns javelins ETC etc
[16:14:30] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: that sounds kind of stupid tbh
[16:14:41] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: I mean its how tribes work IRL
[16:14:45] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: or did
[16:14:46] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: well
[16:14:56] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: I read a rant once about preds, I actually know very little about them
[16:15:05] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Oh my
[16:15:08] SAY: Shitty Bill (NPC) : Blaze one up for Father Jack...
[16:15:15] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: some guy said they were a retarded race that shouldn&#39;t be mixed in with aliens because of how literally every member of the race does hunting
[16:15:22] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: They are one of my favorite things
[16:15:22] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: which is unrealistic
[16:15:40] ADMIN: Alien Empress (Furry Chicken) [DEAD] ASAY: they also seem a lot like humans, that happen to be OP
[16:15:50] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: they are nomads not a civilization lol most are groups of 2-4 family units
[16:16:31] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: basically only really powerful preds lead any thing over 4 people and then they are usually renegade and shy away from hunting tradition
[16:17:00] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Its not explained too well but the gist is &#34;females&#34; run what could be called the &#34;civ&#34; and males basically go hunt shit
[16:17:29] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: and the more trophys and honor you have the better female you get, the stronger your children will be etc... etc
[16:17:48] ADMIN: skeleton (Xenosandbox the Second) [TRAITOR] ASAY: Wow im autistic
